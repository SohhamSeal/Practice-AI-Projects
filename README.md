# Machine Learning Python Files for Dataset Classification

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models written in Python using various algorithms to classify different datasets. The models utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to accurately identify and classify various datasets, mostly sourced from Kaggle.

## Purpose
The aim of this repository is to provide a resource for individuals looking to gain experience in developing machine learning models using CNNs and other ML algorithms. It serves as a place to experiment with different architectures, optimizers, and training epochs to achieve the best possible accuracy and efficiency for the classification tasks.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this repository are mostly sourced from Kaggle, and include a wide range of classifications such as images, audio, and text. Each dataset is preprocessed and formatted to work with the models provided.
